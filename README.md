# Customer Retail Analysis Project

This is a complete data analytics project that utilizes Python, SQL and Power BI to analysze a retail company customers' shopping behaviour in order to improve sales, suctomer satisfaction, and long-term loyalty. The management team has noticed changes in purchasing patterns across demographics, product categories, and sales channels (online vs offline). They are particularly interested in uncovering which factors, such as discounts, reviews, seasons, or payment preferences, drive consumer decisions and repeat purchases.

As a data analyst, the task here is analyszing the company's consumer behaviour dataset to answer this overarching business question: 
**How can the company leverage consumer shopping data to identify trends, improve customer engagement, and optimize marketing and product strategy ?**
